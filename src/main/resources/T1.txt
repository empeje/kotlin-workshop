Using Kotlin:
1) Implement Money (using data class), Currency (using value class) and Percent (using value class) classes in a single Values.kt file, so that refactored.MoneyTest passes
2) Implement DiscountStrategy, (using sealed interface) so that refactored.DiscountStrategyTest passes (you can uncomment TestUtils class)
3) Implement Logger interface with Sout implementation (using object class type). Then implement DiscountCalculator class
    so that refactored.DiscountCalculatorTest passes
